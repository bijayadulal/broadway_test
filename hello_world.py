**Objective**  
Extend current 2D CNN classifier to handle 3D Ising lattices using Graph Neural Networks (PyTorch Geometric).

**Tasks**  
- [ ] Generate 3D Ising simulation data  
- [ ] Adapt current data loader for graph representation  
- [ ] Implement basic GNN architecture  
- [ ] Compare accuracy vs. traditional CNNs  

**Physics Motivation**  
3D systems show different critical exponents (ν ≈ 0.63 vs 2D's ν=1). Can ML detect this change?
